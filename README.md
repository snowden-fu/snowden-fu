### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Snowden (Zheng) Fu, a final year Master of Information Technology student at UNSW with experience in team collaboration and project management.

As a Frontend Developer, I specialize in Python, JavaScript, and Dart. You can find my contributions to the Seeder project on my Github, where I was the monthly top committer. I have also designed prototypes and implemented the frontend in React for the Big Brain project.

I have utilized Agile Scrum practices as the Scrum Master for the EventHub project. You can see my effective communication and leadership skills in the project's Github repository.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. You can follow me on Github for updates on my latest projects and contributions.
